# Driver Icon Template X4 (OS 4)

In X4, we have simplified the creation of driver icons.

### Driver Icon Guidelines

1. 1024 x 1024 Vector-based artwork.
2. Solid background color is recommended.
3. SVG format for export.
4. X4 will handle the UI treatments and use the new Driver parameters to provide information to the User—e.g., badging, battery, and timers.

### Where do I get a Vector-based artwork?

1. Most established companies have a media download section and are happy to provide you with their company branding, as they want to be represented correctly and professionally. e.g. https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/design#using-our-logo

2. If you work with a brand, you can easily request a vector-based version of their logo.

Don’t download a PNG, JPEG, or GIF and save it as SVG.

### Which graphic tool can I use?

Any graphic tool that supports the SVG export format. Sketch, Figma, Illustrator, CorelDRAW, and Inkscape, to name a few.

### Artwork Directions

1. Create a 1024x1024 canvas, document, or artboard.
2. Apply a desired background color; we recommend using what the brand specifies, or duplicate what’s being used in the Apple App Store or Google Play Store.
3. Drop in the artwork. Scale about 70% of the overall dimensions - Centered.
5. Save. Export as SVG.
