JumpStart is a driver development utility that is compatible with Linux and Windows environments. JumpStart works in conjunction with Driver Development Templates 
to fast track driver creation by receiving device specific information from the driver developer to quickly assemble a viable driver that can then further enhanced with 
functionality that is unique to a device.

JumpRefresh Utility
JumpRefresh is a program that is a companion tool to JumpStart. While JumpStart will create source code for a new driver, JumpRefresh only copies template files that are not 
intended to be changed by the driver developer into the driverâ€™s source code. The allows the driver developer to update their driver to use the latest template code without 
overwriting any changes or additions made to the driver code after its initial creation.
