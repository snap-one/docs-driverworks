Jumpstart is a driver development utility that is compatible with Linux and Windows environments. Jumpstart works in conjunction with Driver Development Templates 
to fast track driver creation by receiving device specific information from the driver developer to quickly assemble a viable driver that can then further enhanced with 
functionality that is unique to a device.
